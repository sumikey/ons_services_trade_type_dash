# ons_services_trade_type_dash
A streamlit dashboard for examining data published by the UK ONS on UK services trade by partner country by type of services.  

This dashboard takes data from the UK Office for National Statistic's dataset on UK trade in services by service type and partner country. The original dataset can be found [HERE](https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/internationaltrade/datasets/uktradeinservicesservicetypebypartnercountrynonseasonallyadjusted).  

Currently the dashboard is running a streamlit dashboard with a combination of streamlit and plotly express charts to show some different metrics of UK services trade - the preferred trade partner and type of service can be selected from within the dataset.  

This dashboard is currently running off of a pre-loaded CSV file (included within this github repo), but a future edition will update with data scraped directly from the ONS website.
